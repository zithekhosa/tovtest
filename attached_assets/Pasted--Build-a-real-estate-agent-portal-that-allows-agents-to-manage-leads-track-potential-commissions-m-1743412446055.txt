"Build a real estate agent portal that allows agents to manage leads, track potential commissions, market rental properties, access premium expiring lease data, and post properties on a Zillow-like marketplace. The portal should include:

1️⃣ Leads Management
Add, edit, delete, and categorize leads (New, Contacted, Interested, Negotiating, Closed, Lost).

Assign follow-up reminders and track lead sources.

2️⃣ Commission Tracking
Automatically calculate potential commissions based on deal value and agent commission rates.

Show a dashboard summary of total earnings and pending payments.

3️⃣ Property Posting & Marketing (Zillow-Like Feature)
Agents can post properties for sale or rent with images, descriptions, pricing, and location.

Listings should be visible to website visitors.

Agents can promote properties for increased visibility (paid feature).

Track engagement metrics (views, inquiries, saved properties).

4️⃣ Expiring Lease Alerts (Premium Feature)
Agents can pay to see leases expiring in the next 30-90 days before competitors.

Subscription-based or pay-per-view access to early lease expiry data.

Automated notifications for subscribed agents when a lease is nearing expiration.

5️⃣ Document Management
Securely store and access rental agreements and contracts.

Support digital signatures for lease agreements.

Notify agents of expiring documents.

6️⃣ Agent Dashboard
Overview of leads, commissions, active listings, expiring leases, and property engagement.

Performance analytics (response rates, closed deals, and earnings trends).

7️⃣ User Authentication & Payments
Agents sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.

Payment system for premium features (Stripe or another method).

Different access levels for free and premium users.

8️⃣ Property Search for Buyers & Renters
Public users can search for properties by location, price, and type (sale/rent).

The system should be user-friendly, responsive, and secure."
