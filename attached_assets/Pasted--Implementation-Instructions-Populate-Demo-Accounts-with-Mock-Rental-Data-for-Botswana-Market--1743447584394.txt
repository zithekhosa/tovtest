# Implementation Instructions: Populate Demo Accounts with Mock Rental Data for Botswana Market

## IMPORTANT: This is not a suggestion - this is a direct instruction to implement immediately.

Your task is to populate the demo accounts in our rental/lease management system with localized Botswana mock data so that users can see realistic examples when demonstrating the system. This is a CRITICAL requirement as currently all demo accounts show "no rental information found" when accessing lease history or rental information.

## What needs to be implemented (DO NOT JUST ACKNOWLEDGE, ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THIS):

1. Insert the 20 mock data records (including tenants, properties, leases, and maintenance requests) from the provided JSON structure into our database. All data has been localized with:
   - Botswana names (Kgosi, Lesego, Tumelo, etc.)
   - Botswana locations (Gaborone, Palapye, etc.)
   - Local currency values
   - Local phone number formats
   - Appropriate regional districts

2. Ensure that EVERY demo account has:
   - At least one active lease
   - At least one historical lease
   - Visible payment history for all leases
   - At least one maintenance request (either completed or in progress)

3. Connect these records properly so that:
   - When users click on "lease history," they see a list of their current and past leases
   - When users click on "my rental," they see details about their current property
   - Payment histories are visible and properly formatted
   - Maintenance requests are associated with the correct properties and tenants

## Implementation Deadline:
This must be implemented IMMEDIATELY - not planned for later. The system should display this data within 24 hours.

## Technical Requirements:
- Use the exact data structure provided in the JSON sample with Botswana names and locations
- Maintain all relationships between entities (tenants-leases-properties)
- Generate additional records as needed to reach 20 complete profiles
- Ensure all dates are properly formatted for database storage
- Use Botswana's currency format (Pula) where applicable

## Verification Steps:
1. After implementation, log into 5 different demo accounts
2. Verify each account can access lease history with Botswana-relevant information
3. Verify each account can view detailed rental information for properties in Gaborone and other Botswana locations
4. Verify payment histories are visible with appropriate currency values
5. Send confirmation that implementation is complete with screenshots showing the Botswana content is properly displayed

DO NOT RESPOND WITH ACKNOWLEDGMENT ONLY. RESPOND WITH CONFIRMATION THAT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED THE CHANGES AND POPULATED THE SYSTEM WITH BOTSWANA-SPECIFIC MOCK DATA.
